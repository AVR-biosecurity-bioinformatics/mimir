# `mimir`: a DNA barcode reference database curation pipeline

`mimir` is a [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html)-based pipeline for reference database curation of DNA barcode sequences, such as those required for metabarcoding experiemnts. 

This pipeline is being developed by a team at [Agriculture Victoria Research](https://agriculture.vic.gov.au/), as a part of the [National Grains Diagnostic & Surveillance Initiative (NGDSI)](https://grdc.com.au/grdc-investments/investments/investment?code=DEE2305-004RTX). 

`mimir` is a sibling pipeline to `[freyr](https://github.com/AVR-biosecurity-bioinformatics/freyr)`, which handles sequencing data analysis for metabarcoding experiments. 

> This pipeline is currently **experimental** and being actively developed, with no guarantee that the code is stable!
